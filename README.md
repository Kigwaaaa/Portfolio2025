# Lewis Mwangi - Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio! This project showcases my skills and experiences as a software engineer. Built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), this portfolio highlights my work and expertise in the field.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the portfolio app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes. You might also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.\
This command optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is ready for deployment!

For more details, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If you need to customize the build tool and configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. You will then have full control over these configurations. However, `eject` is not necessary for most projects.
